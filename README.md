# numerical-calculus
Libraries for use in differentiation, integration and root finding.

Libraries for differentiation include:
- Central difference method
- Forward difference method
- Backward difference method
- Second derivative calculation

There is an included demo executable that when run will use the example of a sine function at PI/3

Libraries for integration include:
- Trapezoidal method
- Simpsons Rule
- Newton-Cotes (Degree 3) Formulae

Another demo is included that demonstrates integrating a function log(1+x)/x over a small interval.
(Something to note that these formulae are only accurate over small intervals, especially the Trapezoidal method - as you will see from the demo.)

Next: Adding root finding techniques via the False Position Method
